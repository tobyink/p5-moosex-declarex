=head1 DESCRIPTION

MooseX::DeclareX takes the declarative sugar of L<MooseX::Declare> to the
next level. Some people already consider MooseX::Declare to be pretty insane.
If you're one of those people, then you're not going to like this...

=head2 Keywords

=over

=item C<class>, C<role>, C<extends>, C<with>, C<< is dirty >>, C<< is mutable >>, C<clean>.

Inherited from L<MooseX::Declare>.

=item C<method>, C<around>, C<before>, C<after>, C<override>, C<augment>

Inherited from L<MooseX::Method::Signatures>.

=item C<try>, C<catch>

Inherited from L<TryCatch>.

=item C<exception>

C<< exception Foo >> is sugar for C<< class Foo extends Throwable::Error >>.
That is, it creates a class which is a subclass of L<Throwable::Error>.

=item C<build>

This is some sugar for creating builder methods. The following two examples
are roughly equivalent:

  build fullname {
    join q( ), $self->firstname, $self->surname;
  }

  sub _build_fullname {
    my $self = shift;
    join q( ), $self->firstname, $self->surname;
  }

However, C<build> also performs a little housekeeping for you. If an attribute
does not exist with the same name as the builder, it will create one for you
(which will be read-only, with type constraint "Any" unless C<build> can detect
a more specific type constraint from the method's return signature). If the
attribute already exists but does not have a builder set, then it will set it.

=item C<guard>

Simplifies a common usage pattern for C<around>. A guard protects a method,
preventing it from being called unless a condition evaluates to true.

  class Doorway
  {
    method enter ($person)
    {
      ...
    }
  }
  
  class Doorway::Protected
  {
    has password => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str');
    
    guard enter ($person)
    {
      $person->knows( $self->password )
    }
  }

=item C<preprocess>

Another simplification for a common usage pattern for C<around>. Acts much
like C<before>, but B<can> modify the parameters seen by the base method.
In fact, it must return the processed parameters as a list.

  class Speaker
  {
    method speak (@words) {
      say for @words;
    }
  }
  
  class Speaker::Loud
  {
    preprocess speak {
      return map { uc($_) } @_
    }
  }

=item C<postprocess>

Like C<preprocess> but instead acts on the method's return value.

=item C<read_only>, C<read_write>, C<true>, C<false>

Useful constants when defining Moose attributes. These are enabled by the
std_constants plugin.

=back

=head2 Export

You should indicate which features you are using:

  use MooseX::DeclareX
    keywords => [qw(class role exception)],
    plugins  => [qw(guard build)];

What is the distinction between keywords and plugins? Keywords are the words
that declare class-like things. Plugins are the other bits, and only work
B<inside> the class-like declarations.

Things inherited from MooseX::Declare and MooseX::Method::Signatures do not
need to be indicated; they are always loaded. Things inherited from TryCatch
do not need to be indicated; they are available outside class declarations
too.

If you don't specify a list of keywords, then the default list is:

  [qw(class role exception)]

If you don't specify a list of plugins, then the default list is:

  [qw(build guard std_constants)]

That is, there are certain pieces of functionality which are not available
by default - they need to be loaded explicitly! 

=head2 MooseX::Types

You can inject a bunch of MooseX::Types keywords into all classes quite
easily:

  use MooseX::DeclareX
    keywords => [qw(class role exception)],
    plugins  => [qw(build std_constants)],
    types    => [
      -Moose,                 # use MooseX::Types::Moose -all
      -URI => [qw(FileUri)],  # use MooseX::Types::URI qw(FileUri)
      'Foo::Types',           # use Foo::Types -all
    ];

As per the example, any module which does not include an arrayref of import
parameters, gets "-all". A leading hyphen is interpreted as an abbreviation
for "MooseX::Types::".

=head2 Additional Import Syntactic Sugar

You can specify a list of additional modules that will always be imported
"inside" your class/role definitions.

  use MooseX::DeclareX
    keywords => [qw(class role exception)],
    plugins  => [qw(build guard std_constants)],
    imports  => [
      'MooseX::ClassAttribute',
      'Path::Class'      => [qw( file dir )],
      'Perl6::Junction'  => [qw( any all none )],
      'List::Util'       => [qw( first reduce )],
    ];

In fact, this is just a minor generalisation of the MooseX::Types feature.
